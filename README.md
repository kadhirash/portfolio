## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js and configure everything

Your site will be live in ~1 minute!

### Custom Domain

After deploying:
1. Go to your project settings in Vercel
2. Navigate to "Domains"

5. Done! Your site will be live on your custom domain

## Updating Content

To update your personal info, edit `app/page.tsx`:

Push changes to GitHub and Vercel will automatically redeploy.
